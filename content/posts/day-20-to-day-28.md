# Days 20-28: The Work Gap

I didn't write logs for days 20-28. I didn't code ScrapyChain. I didn't ship progress.

Work got busy. Real busy. The kind of busy where you leave the office at 9 PM and your brain is fried.

But here's what I'm noticing: this is the pattern from "Five Years of Going Nowhere." The moment things get hard or I get distracted, I disappear. No consistency. No "showing up."

The difference is I'm aware of it now. And I'm stopping it before it becomes five months.

## What Happened

Days 20-28 were full work days. Payroll deadlines, system issues, meetings. The usual. By the time I got home, I had two hours max before sleep. The 9-10:45 PM coding window got eaten.

I had a choice: push through tired and write mediocre code, skip the session and pick it up later, or tell myself I was too busy.

I chose option 3. And then option 3 became days 20-28.

## The Problem With Excuses

"I was busy at work" is valid. It's real. But it's also an exit door.

In "Five Years of Going Nowhere," I had the exact same conversation with myself. "I'll start after this project." "I'll pick it back up next week." "I'm too tired right now."

Those were all true. And they all added up to nothing shipped.

## What I'm Doing Now

1. **Acknowledging the gap** - Nine days is nine days. I'm not going to pretend it didn't happen.
2. **Committing to restart** - Starting Day 20 again (or calling it Day 29, doesn't matter).
3. **Being realistic about work** - Some weeks will be busier. I can't control that.
4. **Protecting the 9-10:45 PM window** - This is non-negotiable. Even if it's 30 minutes instead of 105, something is better than nothing.
5. **No backfilling** - I'm not going to cram five days of work into one session. I'm just going to start tomorrow.

## The Real Lesson

Consistency beats intensity. Five days of tired coding beats one day of perfect coding after a week off.

I would rather write 30 minutes of rough code every night than skip nine days and tell myself I'll make it up later. Because I won't. I never do.

## What's Next

Day 20 (or Day 29, or whatever we're calling it): Back to work.

I'm either building ScrapyChain consistently or I'm not. And I've decided I am.

No more nine-day gaps. No more "I'll catch up later." Just showing up.

That's the whole point of this anyway. Becoming the kind of engineer who shows up every day. Even when work is busy. Even when tired. Even when progress is slow.

Especially then.
