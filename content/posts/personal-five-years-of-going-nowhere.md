# Five Years of Going Nowhere

For five years, I convinced myself I was making progress. I wasn't. I was stuck in an endless loop of research, tutorials, and half-finished projects.

Today, I'm done running. And I'm writing this so I don't make the same mistake again.

## The Trap

It started with NFTs. Not as an investor, but as someone who needed to understand how they actually worked. That curiosity pulled me into blockchain, then cryptography, then Rust, then AI. Each one fascinating. Each one a new rabbit hole.

Then came Proof of Terms - my dream project. Reading blockchain whitepapers, I kept getting stuck on dense vocabulary. So I imagined a Rust-based dictionary for blockchain terminology. But manually collecting terms was slow, so I needed a Term Extraction Engine. Building that required NLP research. Which led to more papers. Which led to imagining a decentralized version. Which led to system design.

Then I had what felt like a revelation: what if network protocols themselves could be AI agents? I called it Agentic Internet Architecture and suddenly I was redesigning the entire internet in my head.

Meanwhile, I still couldn't write a basic Rust program without checking the docs.

On top of all this, I was trying to grow my X account. Posting threads, chasing engagement, marketing a product that didn't exist.

NFTs → blockchain → cryptography → Rust → Next.js → AI → Proof of Terms → NLP → system design → agentic internet → network protocols → X content → back to Rust.

Five years. Zero shipped projects.

## What Was Really Happening

I told myself I was being strategic. I wasn't. I was avoiding discomfort.

Every new technology was an escape hatch from the hard parts of the previous one. The moment Rust got difficult, I "needed" to understand cryptography first. The moment I sat down to build the Term Extraction Engine, I "needed" more NLP papers.

Reading documentation felt productive. Watching tutorials felt like learning. Designing concepts in my head felt like building. None of it was. Progress is finishing things.

The worst part? I knew it was happening. I recognized the pattern and still couldn't break free.

## The Breaking Point

One night at 11 PM, I realized I'd spent the entire session researching which blockchain project to contribute to. Seventeen browser tabs open. Zero commits.

So I built a CLI todo app in Rust. Not a blockchain. Not an AI-powered anything. A todo app. I finished it in one session. It was ugly and simple.

It taught me more about Rust's ownership model than months of reading ever did.

## What I'm Doing Now

One project: **ScrapyChain** - a blockchain library in Rust. Not Proof of Terms. Not the Term Extraction Engine. Not the Agentic Internet Architecture. One library. One language.

My rules are simple:

- Build more than I learn. 60/40 split. Learning only happens when stuck on a specific problem.
- Finish before starting anything new.
- When the urge to chase something shiny hits, notice it, write it down, go back to the code.

## What I'd Tell Myself (and You)

**Pick one thing.** The technology matters less than you think. What matters is going deep enough that you actually understand how things work.

**Discomfort means you're learning.** The borrow checker isn't the enemy. It's the teacher. The moment something gets hard is exactly when you should stay.

**Finishing small beats starting big.** A completed CLI tool teaches you more than an abandoned blockchain protocol. Ship something embarrassingly small. The confidence compounds.

**Tutorials are procrastination in disguise.** You can watch enough to feel like a programmer without ever programming.

**You're not falling behind.** The developer who spent five years mastering one language is way ahead of the one who spent five years sampling ten.

## The Real Lesson

The AI and blockchain space sells us a lie: that we need to know everything, that falling behind is fatal, that the next breakthrough changes everything.

It's noise.

The developers I admire got where they are by going deep, not by chasing. They mastered one thing. They shipped. They repeated.

Five years ago, I could have started building ScrapyChain. I'm starting today instead.

If you're stuck in the same loop - researching instead of building, starting instead of finishing, collecting technologies instead of mastering one - this is your sign to stop.

## The Path Forward

Pick one language. Pick one domain. Build something small. Finish it.

That's the whole secret.

I'm building ScrapyChain in public. Every day. No more distractions. No more escape hatches.

If you're on a similar path, this is an invitation to stop running too.
